There are three sections to choose from:

1) DFA (Manual Tests)
2) PDA (Manual Tests)
3) Test Cases (Automatic Testing)

If options 1 or 2 are chosen, the user will then be prompted to input a string:

DFA: a series of 1s and 0s (In any order)
PDA: a number of As, followed by a number of Bs, followed by a number of Cs (In that order)

If 3 is chosen, 20 automatic tests will be run, details can be seen in testCases.h.
